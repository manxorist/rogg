== rogg - Raw Ogg file library and utilities ==

rogg is a small library I wrote for manipulating Ogg streams in memory.

This makes it convenient to write certain quick scripts for checking
and fixing simple bitstream errors in mmap()'d files. 

Examples:

  rogg_aspect will dump and optionally set the pixel aspect ratio
  stored in an Ogg Theora stream.

  rogg_eosfix will set the end_of_stream flag on the last page
  of a stream. This is often unset in downloads truncated from
  an icecast stream.

  rogg_pagedump dumps some basic header information for each page
  in a stream.
